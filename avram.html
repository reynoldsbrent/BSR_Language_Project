                <h3 class="display-6">Significant Contribution</h3>
                <p class="lead"> Henriette's most outstanding achievement was almost single-handedly creating the MARC system. 
                    MARC (Machine-Readable cataloging) is a method of converting paper-and-ink catalogs into digital catalogs and changed how librarians handled cataloging country-wide as it was implemented as a standard in 1971.
                    Even though she was not a librarian, her contributions to the field through her computer science approach resulted in her receiving almost every award in the area. She died from cancer, a disease she once had dreamt of curing, on April 22, 2006. She is buried next to her husband in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia

                <h3 class="display-6">Biography</h3>
                <p>Henriette Regina Davidson Avram was an American programmer and was responsible for the creation of the MARC program. 
                    She was born in 1919 in New York City as a part of the Jewish community and spent much time in her youth at libraries.
                    She attended Hunter College for two years in the pre-medicine field and had dreams of curing cancer, which had been a big part of her family history. 
                    At 21, she cut her studies to marry Herbert Avram, a Navy Lieutenant and chess player. In 1952, Herbert took a job at the NSA, and after a few years of studying math, so did Henriette.
                    There, she became a member of the pioneering generation of computer programmers, a very select group of people. For a woman to be a part of that group in the 50s was extremely rare. They were the only people in the world to program on a computer then. Henriette Avram had many significant feats during her lifetime.
